<p>Bitcoin currency exchanges work in a manner similar to banks. One first deposits amounts 
of money in the currencies supported by the exchange, to his own account in the exchange, 
uses these balances to trade with other users of the exchange and then withdraws that money.

<br>Unlike over-the-counter transactions, there is no risk of losing money due to people not 
fulfilling their part of the deal, as long as the exchange itself does not 
commit fraud or withhold money.
