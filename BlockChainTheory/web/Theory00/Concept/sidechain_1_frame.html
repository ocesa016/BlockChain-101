<br>
<p>Liquid is the First Sidechain for Bitcoin Exchanges
<p>Announced in October 2015 by BlockStram <a href="https://blockstream.com/2015/10/12/introducing-liquid/">[ Announce ]</a> 
<p>Aim is to <i>improve capital efficiency and market liquidity by facilitating rapid and secure transfers between accounts held at any participating exchange or brokerage.</i>
<p>Blockstream, raised $21 million in venture capital late last year to deploy Liquid to be used among exchanges, wallets and other Bitcoin service providers.
<br>
<o>It is unclear if Liquid was ever put it into production. Point is that Liquid is <b>a private sidechain</b>
 that doesn't show statistics. It's based on open source code that is being adopted for the main BitCoin Blockchain at the moment.
