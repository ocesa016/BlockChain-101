<H3>Alternative block chains</H3>
<B>Definition</B>
<br>
<p>Alternative block chains (altchains) are based on bitcoin technology in concept and/or code.
<p>Target performance, anonymity, storage and applications.
<UL>
<br><LI>Namecoin. Digital currency that can store data within a chain
<br><LI>Mastercoin. Metaprotocol with the ability to process various transactions and sub-currencies
<br><LI>Peercoin. Cryptocurrency-based token incorporating proof of stake in its consensus model
<br><li>Litecoin. Based on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer protocol.The main feature is use of scrypt as its proof-of-work algorithm. 
(This change reduces the efficiency gain and economic incentive to develop custom hardware such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). While ASICs can be adopted for any purpose and are likely to be introduced for Litecoin, the use of scrypt should delay this change, and preserve the decentralization in mining that brings a decentralized currency so much of its value and resiliency.)
The second important feature is a reduced transaction confirmation time targeted at 2.5 minutes on average. 
<br><LI>Colored Coins. Use the Bitcoin blockchain to store small amounts of metadata on the blockchain which can be used to represent asset manipulation instructions. For example, we can encode in a Bitcoin transaction that 100 units of a new asset were issued and are now credited to a given bitcoin address. A colored coins wallet can create a Bitcoin transaction that encodes sending 50 units of an asset from one address to a new address, and so on.

<br><i>n.d.r. The term altchain is reported here for completenes. With the recent evolution of the 
tecnology there are several alternative blockchain than the original bitcoin</i>
