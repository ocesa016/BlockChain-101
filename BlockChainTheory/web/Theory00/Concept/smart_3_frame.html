<H3>Smart Contracts</H3>
<B>A word of caution</B>
<br>
<p>DANGER !!!
<p>One of the strenght of the smart contract <i>the program itself is recorded on the blockchain</i> 
is also one of the big weakness.
<p>The program becomes immutable, hence it is not possible to update it in case of Bugs.
<p>Patterns exists to overcome the problem, but those patterns also allow the contract owner to change 
the contract terms unilaterally. 
<p>Rule of Tumb: Be carefull when dealing with smart contracts in permiossionless block chains. 
Use extra cautions where your counterpart is the owner / creator of the contract.
