<H3>Mining</H3>
<B>Mining Bitcons</B>
<br>
<p>It is now impossible to profitably mine Bitcoin with your computer. 
<br>Nowadays mining is performed using specialized <a href="https://www.hobbymining.com/mining-hardware/">[ ASICs ]</a> hardware.

<br><br><B>Mining Pools</B>   
<p>Mining, once done on the average home computer, is now mostly done in large, specialized warehouses. 
<p>These warehouses usually direct their hashing power (Hash rate: How many hashes per second can the miner make) 
 towards mining pools. 
 Mining pools are groups of cooperating miners who agree to share block rewards in proportion 
 to their contributed mining hashing power.
<p>While mining pools are desirable to the average miner as they smooth out rewards and make 
  them more predictable, they unfortunately concentrate power to the owner of the mining pool. 
  Miners can, however, choose to redirect their hashing power to a different mining pool at anytime.

<br><br><B>Pool Mining By Country</B> 
<UL>
<br><LI><b>China</b> is a world leader in Bitcoin mining and trading. 
Chinese mining pools control more than 60% of the network hash rate. 
Massive mining farms are located in China and pointed at these mining pools.
(This is so because of Cheap Electricity and Excess Coal)
<br><LI><b>Georgia</b> is home to BitFury, one of the largest producers of 
Bitcoin mining hardware and chips. BitFury currently mines about 15% of all bitcoins.
<br><LI><b>Sweden</b> is home to KnCMiner, a Bitcoin mining company based in Stockholm. 
KnCMiner currently mines about 7.5% of all bitcoins.
<br><LI><b>United States</b> is home to 21 Inc, a Bitcoin mining company based in California mines about 3% of all bitcoins.
<br><LI>The countries above mine about 80% of all bitcoins. The rest of the hash power is spread across the rest of 
the world, often pointed at smaller mining pools like Slush (Czech Republic) and Eligius (United States).

<br><br><B>Cloud Mining</B>
<p>Most cloud mining contracts are scams. It is easy for companies to take peoples money, and then not pay out. 
A company can claim to be a cloud mining company without any proof of actually owning any hardware. 
<br>So remember: 99% of cloud mining companies are scams.
<br>A noticeable exception is <a href="https://www.genesis-mining.com/">[ Genesis Mining ]</a>
