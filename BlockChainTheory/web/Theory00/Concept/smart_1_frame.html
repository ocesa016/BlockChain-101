<H3>Smart Contracts</H3>
<B>Technology</B>
<br>
<p>The first blockchains were designed to perform a small set of simple operations.
<p>Techniques have been developed to allow blockchains to perform more complex operations, defined in full-fledged programming languages.
<p>Because these programs are run on a blockchain, they have unique characteristics compared to other types of software. 
<UL>
<br><LI>The program itself is recorded on the blockchain, which gives it a blockchain characteristic permanence and censorship resistance.
<br><LI>The program can itself control blockchain assets. for exapmle it can store and transfer amounts of cryptocurrency.
<br><LI>The program is executed by the blockchain, meaning it will always execute in a trustless enviromnet as written and no one can interfere with its operation.
</UL>   
<br>
<p>Smart contracts are really software code that runs on a blockchain. Actions are triggered by some external input, that lets them modify some data. Very similar to an event-driven artifact.
<p>Any Ethereum application you read bout is made out of smart contract code.
