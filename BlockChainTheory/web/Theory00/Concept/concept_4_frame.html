<H3>Block Chain Concepts</H3>
<B>Second Generation Block Chain</B>
<br>
<p>Block Chains are evolving to add more than cryptocurrency an transations. 
<p>They have advanced functionalities like stealth addresses, smart contracts, side chains or assets.
<br><br><B>Stealth addresses:</B>  
<br>A mechanism that allows to solve the problem you face when you wish to solicit payments from the 
public and yet hide all the payments you received. When you publish a single "stealth address" on your website, 
the block chain sees all your incoming payments as going to separate addresses and has no way to correlate them.
Digital Assets and Smart Property
<br><br><B>Digital assets:</B>    
<br>Building up on colored coins, digital assets are assets whose ownership is recorded digitally.
Bitcoins are of digital assets, but since the Block Chain is a decentralized asset registry, 
it can also be used to register ownership and transfer of any digital asset besides bitcoins. 
Taking this concept one step further is in the form of Smart Properties. A Smart Property is a property 
that has access to the Block Chain, and can take actions based on the information published there.
