<B>What is mining for ?</B>

<p>Mining is crucial to Permissionless Blockchain and its security. 
Without miners, Blockchain would be vulnerable and easy to attack. 
Miners are responsible for the creation of new Blocks in the block chain 
and are rewarded for this effort with new tokens.

<p>Originally, Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be mined on computer CPUs. However, 
Bitcoin miners discovered they could get more hashing power from graphic cards. 
<br>Graphic cards were then surpassed by ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).

<p>Block Chain mining is very much dependent on the consensus mechanism endorsed 
 by the block chain, the hashing mechanism used.
<br>In the following pages we see where we stand on mining for the diffenre blockchains.
