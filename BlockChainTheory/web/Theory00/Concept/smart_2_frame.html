<H3>Smart Contracts</H3>
<B>Application</B>
<br>
<p>The term <i>Smart contract</i> here refers to the possibility to use the blockchain technology to complement, or replace, existing legal contracts. 
<p>As defined by <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/making-sense-smart-contracts/">[ Josh Stark - Making Sense of Blockchain Smart Contracts ]</a> 
<i> the use of code running on the blockchain to articulate, verify, and enforce an agreement between parties. A smart legal contract.</i>

<br><br><B>Smart Contracts as Financial Instruments</B>

<p>Since early 2015, the use cases attracting the most attention are smart legal contracts 
as smart financial instruments like shares, bonds, or derivatives contracts.

<p>These smart financial instruments do not exist at scale today, although many people are working to build them. 
R3 recently announced Corda platform is designed to facilitate this type of smart-contract. 
Digital Asset Holdings recently acqui-hired Elevance, a Swiss firm that has developed a way to model 
financial agreements in code.

<br><br><B>Smart Contracts in Other Domains</B>
<p>As the technology matures, other assets like real estate, valuable goods etc. may be stored and traded over blockchain systems. 
 As new asset types go on the blockchain the agreements used to govern those assets in the world today (like a mortgage or licensing agreement) 
 may benefit from blockchain-based analogs.
<p>They could apply to almost anything that changes its state over time, and could have a value attached to it.
<p>There are wide ranges of possibility where the Smart Contracts can imitate or complement the existing legal contracts we use today, 
where leveraging the befefits offered by the blockchain could produce noticeable advantages.


<br><br><B>Smart Contracts and new possibilities</B>

<p>Rather than merely imitate or complement the legal contracts we use today,
smart contract code could be used to facilitate new types of commercial arrangements.

<p>The most widely discussed opportunity of this type is machine-to-machine commerce. 
The growing ecosystem of smart devices will eventually need a way to engage in basic commercial interactions 
with one another. For instance, a washer that buys its own detergent or a car that can pay to recharge itself.

<p>These transactions still require a minimum level of trust to be commercially viable, 
but are not fitting traditionl legal contracts, which are comparatively expensive and require the 
involvement of legal persons like a corporation or human. 

<p>Smart alternative contracts might enable an entirely new type of commerce carried out between
 our computers, cars, phones, and appliances.


<br><br><B>Where are we from a legal prospective ?</B>

<p>There is no defined legal status for Smart Contracts.  

<p>Could smart legal contracts ever be considered legally enforceable? Probably. Despite what many think, the conditions 
under which an agreement becomes a legally enforceable contract are flexible and attuned to the underlying relationship 
between the parties, rather than dependent on the form the contract takes. Anything from a verbal agreement to an email 
conversation can become a contract at law

<p>Legal agreements are full of clauses that protect parties from various edge-case liabilities, and these 
are not always suitable for representation and execution through code, meaning that smart legal contracts will require 
(at least for the foreseeable future) a blend between code and natural language.
