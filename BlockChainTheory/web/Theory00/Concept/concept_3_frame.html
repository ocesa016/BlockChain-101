<B>A consensus mechanism</B>
<br>
<p>In a centralized architecture, a single autoritative entity determines the state of transactions andn holds a copy of the database.
<p>In a distributed architecture each node holds a copy of the database (the block chain) and determines the state of transactions. 
<p>The consensus mechanism is a set of rules the network nodes uses to verify transaction, share and agree the current state of the blockchain. 
<br>       
<br>There are different types of consensus mechanism:       
<UL>
<br><LI><B>Proof-of-work.</B> Based on nodes competing in the addition of transaction to the block. 
<br><LI><B>Byzantine-fault-tolerant.</B> A consensus method between authenticated validators.
<br><LI><B>Proof-of-stake.</B> disincentive mechanism for nodes that do not follow the consensus protocol.
</UL>  

<p>In permissionless systems, a reward in cryptocurrency is usually given to nodes for each generated block that matches the consensus mechanism (proof-of-work). 
This  an incentive provided in order to join and protect the network. This process goes under the name of <b>mining</b>. 

<p>An incentive mechanism is not required in permissioned systems, making this type of architecture more indicated in enterprise solutions.
