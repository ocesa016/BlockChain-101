<H3>Smart Contracts</H3>
<B>Definition</B>
<br>
<p>Wikipedia: <i>Smart contracts are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of
a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary.</i>

<p>Smart contracts first introduced by <a href="http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Economics/SmartContracts.html">[ Nick Szabo in 1994 ]</a> then 
    had a long gestation period of inactivity and disinterest, because there was no platform that 
    could enforce them, until the advent of blockchain technology in 2009. 
<p>Now, smart contracts are entering their prime, especially since Ethereum has popularized them further by making their programming a 
    basic tenet of their blockchain's power. 
<p>Actually the term <i>smart contract</I> has no clear and settled definition.
