<H3>Block Chain Concepts</H3>
<B>A network of peer-to-peer nodes.</B>
<br>
<p>The network nodes imply that a certain peer-to-peer network protocol is used. 
<p>There are basically 2 type of blockchain networks: 
<UL>
<br><LI><B>Permissionless</b> Anyone can join the network hence partecipating to the transaction validation. (Bitcoin and Ethereum). 
<br><LI><B>Permissioned</b> Access to the network (for nodes and partecipants) is restricted to a set of known well known entities. 
</UL>   
<br>
<p>An ongoing debate disputes whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by
a central authority, should still be considered a block chain.
<p>Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term “blockchain” is rightly applied to any data structure
which batches data into blocks which are timestamped and that these blockchains serve as a distributed version of
multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.
<p>The opponents say that the permissioned systems look like traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized
verification of the data, and that such systems are not hardened against tampering and revision by their operators.
<p><i>n.d.r The real point is the consensus algoritm that is used in a permissioned network and easily it can be hakered.</i>
