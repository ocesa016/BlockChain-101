<H3>NXT</H3>
<B>NXT</B>
<br>

<br><br><b>History</b> 
<p>Launched in November 2013 by anonymous software developer BCNext. Nxt was specifically conceived as a 
flexible platform around which to build applications and financial services.
<p>The core infrastructure of Nxt is complex. This adds risks as compared to the more lean bitcoin,
 but makes it easier for external services to be built on top of the blockchain

<p> On 28 September 2013 Bitcointalk.org member BCNext created a forum thread announcing the proposed 
launch of Nxt as a second generation cryptocurrency and asking for small bitcoin donations to determine
how to distribute the initial stake. On 18 November 2013 fundraising for Nxt was closed, with 21 BTC raised. 
The genesis block was published on 24 November 2013. It revealed that 1,000,000,000 coins had been
distributed to 73 stakeholders in proportion to their level of contribution.[2] 
The source code was partially released on 3 January. The full source code was released on 1 March 2014 under 
the MIT License.

<br><br><b>Consensus Mechanism</b> 
<p>Nxt was the first currency to rely purely on proof-of-stake for consensus. 
Allowing a block creation rate of roughly one minute.    
<p> While bitcoin uses hashing power as proof for verifying transactions, Nxt works with the stake-size the user owns.
 Block authors are selected in a practically random manner, with greater amounts of stake increasing the likelihood 
 of adding a block to the chain. While in the case of bitcoin the cost of investing in mining gear serves as an 
 incentive not to attack the network, anyone seeking to attack Nxt would in the process necessarily reduce the 
 value of their personal coin holdings. This effectively avoids the security issue of a miner gaining 51% 
 of the hashing power and attacking the network.

<p> Since Nxt has an unchanging coin supply, no new units are created for block rewards. 
Instead the transaction fees are passed on. After owning Nxt for about one day (1440 confirmations),
the Nxt software will begin to contribute to the block generation process and can potentially earn coins 
for as long as an account is "unlocked".

<p> A mechanism under the name of "transparent forging", a process which allows the software to predict which
 accounts will forge upcoming blocks. This is basically done by iterating through all active accounts and seeing 
 which one has the highest "hit". Transparent forging rapidly increases transaction processing, since the
 account that will forge the next block is known. Another benefit of this feature is that accounts that are 
 due to forge, but do not, will be penalized by having their forging power temporarily reduced to zero. 
 This raises the threshold for an attack to 90%.

<p>The Proof-of-Stake algorithm requires little computation and energy, and can run on smartphones and 
small devices like the Raspberry Pi platform.

<H3>Features</H3>
<br><br><b>Asset Exchange</b> 
A peer-peer exchange allowing decentralized trading of shares, crypto assets. Since the blockchain is an unalterable public ledger of transactions, the Asset Exchange provides a trading record for items other than Nxt.

<br><br><b>Data Storage</b> 
Arbitrary Messages enable the sending of encrypted or plain text, which can also function to send and store up to 
1000 bytes of data permanently, or 42 kilobytes of data for a limited amount of time. 
As a result, it can be used to build file-sharing services, decentralized applications, and higher-level Nxt services.


<br><br><b>Voting System</b> 
Allowing holders of the currency or Nxt-Assets to vote in a cryptographically proven and externally verifiable way

<br><br><b>Monetary System</b> 
Implemented in version 1.4.8,[21] the Monetary System allows the creation of currencies on the Nxt blockchain.[22][23]
These coins are backed by a specified amount of NXT, which can be redeemed if necessary.

<H3>Criticism</H3>
<br><br><b>Nothing at Stake Attacks</b>
It is proposed that one could attack any Proof-of-Stake currency with zero costs. 
There are several proposed attack vectors. These include attempting to build blocks in every fork
in the network, because doing so costs them almost nothing and ignoring any fork may mean losing 
out on the block rewards that would be earned if that fork were to become the chain with the 
largest cumulative difficulty.

<br><br><b>Distribution</b>
Since Nxt had no mining phase, all initial units were released to 73 people through a one-time fund 
raiser via bitcoins, after the announcement of the NXT project in the bitcointalk-forums by its inventor BCnext.

<br><br><b>User-generated passwords</b>
To access an account, the user types a password or a passphrase from which a private key is calculated, 
unlike bitcoin, where private keys are typically stored in a wallet file and not directly visible to the user
