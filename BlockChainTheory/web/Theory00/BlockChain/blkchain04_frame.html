<H3>Block Chain </H3>
<br>How the nodes compete with each other to include Alice's transaction into a new block in a process called <B>Mining</B>
<br>Each Node: 
<UL>
<br><LI><B>1 </B>Takes the transactions and places them in a merkle tree of the new block 
<br><LI><B>2 </B>Performs a computation to produce the <B>proof of work</B>
</UL>   
<br>Mining is very difficult to produce but very easy to verify.
