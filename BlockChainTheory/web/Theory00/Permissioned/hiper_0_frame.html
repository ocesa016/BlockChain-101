<br><br><b>History</b> 
<p>
  Hyperledger (or the Hyperledger project) is a cross-industry collaborative effort, started in December 2015 by 
  the Linux Foundation, to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers. It is focused on ledgers designed 
  to support global business transactions, including major technological, financial, and supply chain companies, 
  with the goal of improving many aspects of performance and reliability.
   The project aims to bring together a number of independent efforts to develop open protocols and standards, 
   by providing a modular framework that supports different components for different uses. 
   This would include a variety of blockchains with their own consensus and storage models, 
   and services for identity, access control, and contracts.
