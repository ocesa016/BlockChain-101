<p>Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network by Ripple. 
  Also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol.

<p>It is built upon a distributed open source Internet protocol, consensus ledger and native 
 currency called XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable secure, instant 
 and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.
<p>It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit 
of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.

<p>Currently implemented by companies such as UniCredit, UBS or Santander, the Ripple protocol has 
been increasingly adopted by banks and payment networks as settlement infrastructure technology.

<p> In May 2011, they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified 
  by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin,
  was therefore designed to eliminate bitcoin's reliance on centralized exchanges, use less electricity
   than bitcoin, and perform transactions much more quickly than bitcoin.

<br><br><b>History</b> 
<p>The predecessor to the Ripple payment protocol, Ripplepay, was first developed in 2004. 
 May 2011, they began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified
 by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by bitcoin, 
 which relies on blockchain ledgers.

<p>In September 2012 the team co-founded the corporation OpenCoin and begun began developing a
   new payment protocol called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) based on Ryan Fugger's 
  concepts.[21] The Ripple protocol enables the instant and direct transfer of money between two parties
<p>On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin Inc. changed its name to Ripple Labs Inc.  
<p>Since 2013, the protocol has been adopted by an increasing number of financial institutions.
The year 2015 and 2016 marked the expansion of Ripple (company) with the opening of an office in Sydney, 
Australia in April 2015 and the opening of European offices in London, 
United-Kingdom in March 2016 then in Luxembourg in June 2016. Many companies have subsequently 
announced experimenting and integrations with Ripple.
<p> In July 2014, Ripple Labs proposed Codius, a project to develop a new smart 
contract system that is programming language agnostic.

<br><br><b>The Bitcoin Bridge</b> 
<p>The bitcoin bridge is a link between the Ripple and bitcoin ecosystems. The bridge makes it possible to pay any bitcoin user straight from 
a Ripple account without ever needing to hold any of the digital currency (no need to use exchange such as BTC-E)
