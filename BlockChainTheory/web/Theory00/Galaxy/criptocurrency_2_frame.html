<B>Litecoin (LTC)</B>
<br>
<p>Litecoin (a lite version of Bitcoin) was released October 7, 2011.
<p>Litecoin is the fourth-largest true cryptocurrency by market capitalization

<p>The main feature is use of scrypt as its proof-of-work algorithm. 

<p> The original intended purpose of using Scrypt was to allow miners to mine both Bitcoin and Litecoin
 at the same time. The choice to use scrypt was also partially to avoid giving advantage 
 to video card (GPU), FPGA and ASIC miners over CPU miners.

<p>While ASICs can be adopted for any purpose and are likely to be introduced for Litecoin, 
the use of scrypt should delay this change, and preserve the decentralization in mining 
that brings a decentralized currency so much of its value and resiliency.)

<p>The second important feature is a reduced transaction confirmation time targeted at 2.5 minutes on average.
