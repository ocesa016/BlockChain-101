<B>Monero (XMR)</B>
<br>
<p>Monero is an open source cryptocurrency created in April 2014 that is focused on privacy, 
decentralisation and scalability. Monero focuses on the use on Darknet Market.
<p>Unlike many cryptocurrencies that are derivatives of Bitcoin, Monero is based on the
CryptoNote protocol and possesses significant algorithmic differences relating to blockchain obfuscation.
<p>Monero was forked from Bytecoin in April 2014, (Bytecoin was the first implementation of the CryptoNote 
protocol launched in July 2012)

<br><br><b>CryptoNote</b> 
<p>CryptoNote is an application layer protocol that powers several decentralized privacy oriented digital currencies. 
<p>Transactions cannot be followed through the blockchain in a way that reveals who sent or received coins. 
<br>The approximate amount of a transaction can be known, but the origin, destination, or actual amount cannot be learned. 
The only information available is that the actual amount was lower than the displayed amount. 
<p>The only people with access to the whole set of data about a transaction are the sender or receiver 
    of the transaction and the person who possesses one or both secret keys.

<p>To prevent sender identification, CryptoNote groups the sender's public key with several 
other keys (more precisely, it groups the sender's output with several other's outputs), 
making it impossible to tell who actually sent the transaction.
<p>If ring signatures are used, all possible senders referenced in the transaction are 
equiprobable and there is no way to determine the exact private key used while signing.
<p>This approach does not require dedicated master nodes for mixing coins and does not need 
 other users to actively participate in transaction generation (see CoinJoin).

<br><br><b>Decentralization</b> 
<p>Monero is powered strictly by Proof of Work, but specifically, it employs a mining algorithm 
that has the potential to be efficiently tasked to billions of existing devices (any modern x86 CPU).
Monero uses the CryptoNight Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, which is designed for use in ordinary CPUs.

<p>The smart mining forthcoming feature will allow transparent CPU mining on the user's computer, 
far from the de facto centralization of mining farms and pool mining, pursuing Satoshi Nakamoto's 
original vision of a true P2P currency.
