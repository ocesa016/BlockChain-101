<B>A bit of history</B>
<br>
<p>A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange based on cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional coins.
<p>A cryptocurrency is mined using a hashing function. The two most popular hashing functions are SHA-256 and Script, but several others are used.
<p>As Bitcoin grew in popularity, ASIC SHA-256 machines were built which made GPU mining obsolete.
