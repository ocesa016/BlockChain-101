<p>Dash (formerly known as Darkcoin and XCoin) is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that offers instant 
transactions (InstantSend), private transactions (PrivateSend) and token fungibility. 
It was rebranded from "Darkcoin" to "Dash" on March 25, 2015, a portmanteau of "Digital Cash".
<br>As of 2016, Dash is among the top-7 most popular cryptocurrencies.

<br><br><b>PrivateSend</b>
<p>In its current implementation it adds privacy to transactions by combining identical inputs 
from multiple users into a single transaction with several outputs.
Due to the identical inputs, transactions usually cannot be directly traced, obfuscating the flow of funds. 
PrivateSend makes Dash "Fungible"[9] by mixing the coins in the same denomination with other wallets, 
ensuring that all coins are of the same value.

<br><br><b>Masternodes</b>
<p>PrivateSend's mixing is performed by Masternodes, servers operating on a decentralized network which have the responsibility of signing the transactions. For each round of PrivateSend, the user selects two to eight (or even more) rounds of mixing which vary the degree of anonymity achieved. Random Masternodes are then elected to perform the coin mixing. Masternodes are trust-less cryptographic technology, in the sense that they cannot steal user coins, and the combination of multiple Masternodes ensures that no single node has full knowledge of both inputs and outputs in the transaction process.

<br><br><b>InstantSend</b>
<p>InstantSend is a service that allows for near-instant transactions. Through this system, inputs can be locked to only specific transactions and verified by consensus of the Masternode network. Conflicting transactions and blocks are rejected. If a consensus cannot be reached, validation of the transaction occurs through standard block confirmation

<br><br><b>Fungibility</b>
<p>If certain coins have a history linked to people, organizations, or activity, then the value isnâ€™t the same.  Some entities may not accept coins based on past history.  The term fungibility ensures that all coins are the same value.  The way Dash makes this happen is by mixing the coins in the same denomination with other wallets.  This effectively erases all history and ensures they are worth the same value.  As far as I know, Dash is the only crypto that is truly fungible.

<br><br><b>decentralized autonomous organization</b>
Dash operates a decentralized governance and budgeting system, making it the first decentralized 
autonomous organization.
Dash is the first decentralized autonomous organization powered by a Sybil proof decentralized 
governance and funding system.[16] DGBB or Decentralized Governance By Blockchain as it's called 
is a decentralized process by which the network determines where money is spent.

<br><br><b>Hashing</b>
<p>Dash uses a chained hashing algorithm called X11 for the proof-of-work. 
Instead of using the SHA-256 (from well-known Secure Hash Algorithm family) or scrypt it uses 
11 rounds of different hashing functions. With chained hashing, high end CPUs give an average 
return similar to that of GPUs. Another side effect of the algorithm is that GPUs run at about 30% 
less electrical power than scrypt and 30% to 50% cooler, putting less stress on the computing 
setup and ensuring lower energy bills for miners.
