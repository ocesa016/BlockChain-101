<B>Overview</B>
<br>
<p>The idea of digital currency was first introduced in 1985 in a writing by David Chaum.
<p>1998, Wei Dai published a description of <i>b-money</i>, an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.
Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo created <i>Bit Gold</i>. Other efforts were attempted and failed.
<p>The first decentralized cryptocurrency, <b>bitcoin</b>, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi
Nakamoto.
<p>Bitcoin demonstrates that two unrelated entities can exchange digital assets in real time without the need of a central authority.  
<p>This has created a whidespread interest with the focus shifting from cryptocurrency to the potentials that technology underneath offers.
