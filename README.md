
The BlockChain-101
======================
This is the BlockChain-101 package.
	
Ever wondered what a BlockChain is ?     
Curious on what is in store behind BitCoins ?  
Can a contract really become *Smart* ?   

This is the right place to find answers to those type of questions.  

Available Packages
==================

This project is made by a set of independed and self-contained
packages, each with it's own purpose and state of evolution. 

Each pachage adresses a specific aspect or tecnology. Refer to the 
README.pl file of each project for project specific instructions. 


1. BlockChainTheory *(Work In Progress. Pre-Alfa stage)*
--------------------------------------
This package is dedicated to divulgative aspects of the BlockChain tecnology. 
      

2. Ethereum *(Complete and Working)*
--------------------------------
This package is dedicated to the Ethereum BlockChain.       
It will setup a test/stand alone (disconnected from the real Ethereum block chain) Ethereum node.    
This package contains a prototype of an *Ethereum DAPP* (Distributed APPlication)
with a *Smart Contract* that simulates the purchase and delivery of items.  
You interact with the contract (and your local node) using the WEB interface.
